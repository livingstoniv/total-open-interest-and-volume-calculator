# total-open-interest-and-volume-calculator
This program finds the total open long interest, short interest, long volume and short volume  into a pandas data frame which can be exported into an excel sheet, simply run the program and enter a ticker (make sure the ticker has options contracts, or the program may not work). This project was inspired by AdamGetbags.
