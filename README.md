# total-open-interest-and-volume-calculator
This program finds the total open long interest, short interest, long volume and short volume  into a pandas data frame which can be exported into an excel sheet, simply run the program and enter a ticker (make sure the ticker has options contracts, or the program may not work). 

The idea behind this program is to see where the most money in the options market is allocated to make better investment decisions.
